The client code is in `wsClient` and you can run it from sbt directly.
The main function has two variables that can be set in the code. Those variables are for changing the load. You should add your own server address in the code as well.
The client also prints out anything that it recieves and you can use that for debugging purpuses or loop back time calculation.
